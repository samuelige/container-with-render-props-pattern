This project is a simple and practical example of how to use the **Render Props Pattern** in React to separate logic from presentation, making components more flexible and reusable.

## ðŸ“– About the Project

In React, the **Render Props Pattern** allows you to share logic between components by passing a function as a prop. This function returns the UI you want to render, based on the internal state or data managed by the component.

This project demonstrates:
- How to build a reusable component using Render Props
- How to fetch and render dynamic data flexibly
- How to separate logic (data fetching) from presentation (UI rendering)
